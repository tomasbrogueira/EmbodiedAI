"""Pure-Python enum definitions mirroring the NCCL EP C enums.

Defined here (rather than re-exported from a generated bindings module) so
the public API does not depend on any code-generation tool's naming
conventions and so each member can carry a docstring describing its
semantics. Values mirror the corresponding C enums in ``ep_enums.h``
